# A circular linked list
# 1 -> 2 -> 10 ->
# 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 10 -> 
# only next pointers
# can assume list is already sorted 
# There is no concept of a head pointer
#
# insert(n, val_to_insert)
#
# insert val_to_insert and make sure the list remains sorted
#
# n - a pointer somewhere into the list, you dont necessarily know where
